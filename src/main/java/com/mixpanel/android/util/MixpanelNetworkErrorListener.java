   * Called when a network request within the Mixpanel SDK fails. This method may be called on a

   * @param ipAddress The IP address resolved from the endpointUrl's hostname for this attempt (may
   *     be "N/A" if DNS lookup failed).
   * @param durationMillis The approximate duration in milliseconds from the start of this specific
   *     connection attempt until the exception was thrown.
   * @param uncompressedBodySize The size in bytes of the request body *before* any compression.
   *     Will be -1 if no body was sent.
   * @param compressedBodySize The size in bytes of the request body *after* Gzip compression. Will
   *     be -1 if no body was sent or if compression was not enabled (in which case uncompressed
   *     size applies).

   *     if no response code could be retrieved (e.g., connection error).
   * @param responseMessage The HTTP response message returned by the server, if available. Defaults
   *     to empty string if no response message could be retrieved.
   * @param exception The exception that occurred (e.g., IOException, EOFException, etc.).
