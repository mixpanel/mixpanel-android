In order to support gradle and Android Studio while continuing to support older
build tools, the Mixpanel library contains a complete Eclipse/Ant android project
inside of its src/main directory. To include the library in your ant or Eclipse
project, add the following library reference to your project's project.properties file:

android.library.reference.1=RELATIVE_PATH_TO_THE_MIXPANEL_DIRECTORY/src/main
