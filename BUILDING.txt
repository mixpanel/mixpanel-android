Building the Mixpanel Library
=============================

The Mixpanel library is built using ant. To build, enter the root
directory of the repository and type

    $ ANDROID_HOME='location of your android SDK directory' ant library

This will produce the file MPMetrics_v2.1.jar, and place it in the
root directory of the repository. You can copy the jar into the libs/
directory of your android projects and use them to interact with Mixpanel.

Building the Demo and Test Projects
===================================

The root Mixpanel project is not configured to use Eclipse to build and
run, but repository also contains a demo and a test project that can
(and should) be build and run within the Android Eclipse environment.

To work with these projects, you should import the following directories
as Eclipse projects:

   demo/Hello Mixpanel
   test/

The test project depends on the demo project to run.
